# Web Platform UI Updates

- Rebuilt landing page sections with new components: `HeroSection`, `ValueSection`, `FeaturesSection`, `SocialProof`, `FinalCTA`, and refreshed `Navigation`/`Footer` for premium layout and CTAs.
- Added scroll-reveal animations via `useScrollReveal` hook and supporting `reveal` utility classes for fade/translate transitions.
- Implemented parallax hero background, navbar blur-on-scroll, and standardized interactive hover states for buttons and cards.
- Updated styling utilities in `src/index.css` and layout defaults in `src/App.css` to support full-width responsive presentation.
- Switched to a dark cinematic palette with white typography, glass cards, hover glows, and expanded features (AI curation, automated reminders).
- Added animated hero overlay with mouse-responsive parallax and hover-reactive headline/tagline effects.
- Introduced `EventsCarousel` with auto-play/hover-pause, smooth slide transitions, and glowing cards to surface featured events.
